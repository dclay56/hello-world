tutorial on using git
So just started using this to learn about it so I can be somewhat of use in the future.
I have seen this before but never actully used it yet so im excited to learn about it.
It looks interesting and very useful so I decided why not give it a  try.
Hopefully I will get better and be of some use to someone in the future.
